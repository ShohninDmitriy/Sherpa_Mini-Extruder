This is a toolhead carriage combo for Tiny-M, utilizing the Sherpa Mini extruder as a direct drive option. I have opened up the parts cooling fan spacing to allow for a easier time installing
the cooling fans. Also added zip tie slots to allow for some cable managment from the hotend.

Special thank you to discord user wenndemann for his work on the Mosquito toolhead!

Happy printing!
