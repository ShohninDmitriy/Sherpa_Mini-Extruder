# Based of the STLs from Sherpa Mini R1 

# General info  
 - Only changes have been the hole sizing on the core and rear housing.
 - Holes have been resized to fit the smaller m3 inserts, been test fited to work with the ruthex m3 ones. 
 - For all other assembly info please check the main sherpa docs and I'll try to keep these files as up to date as possible.
